## Overview

In this project, I have worked with Node.js, which is the runtime environment for JavaScript. I have utilized Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, to create a web application. Through this project, I gained knowledge of various features of Express.js, including routing, middleware, template engines, and request handling.

## Database

The project utilizes a non-SQL database, MongoDB, for data storage. MongoDB is gaining popularity due to its usability, easy functions, and fewer rules and regulations compared to SQL databases.

## Mongoose

To interact with the MongoDB database, I have used the Mongoose library, which is based on Object Document Mapping (ODM). Mongoose helps Node.js interact with the database and allows defining schemas and models in a JavaScript object format. Some key features of Mongoose include schemas, models, middleware, validation, virtual properties, and queries.

## MongoDB Atlas

For hosting the MongoDB database server online, I have used MongoDB Atlas. It is a platform that provides free space to host a MongoDB server online.

## Hosting

To host the Node.js server online, I have utilized Render, a free service for hosting Node.js servers for learning projects. Render is simple to use and provides a convenient hosting solution for developers.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I have gained confidence in various backend technologies, including Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Compass (a GUI for MongoDB), Git and GitHub (version control), and Render (hosting).
